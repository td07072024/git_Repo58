Vaidyanatham Chitabhoomau (1/21-24)[3] and Shivamaha puran Shatarudra Samhita (42/1-4)[4] are the ancient verses that identify the location of Vaidyanth Jyotirlinga. According to which Shri Vaidyanatham is in 'Chitabhoomi', Dwadasha jyotirlinga stotram, Adi Sankaracharya has praised Shri Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga location in following verses, before Shivamaha puran Shatarudra Samhita as following:[5]

Sourashtre Somanadham, cha Sri Shaile Mallikarjunam, Ujjayinyam Maha Kalam, Omkaram, amaleshwaram, Vaidyanatham Chitabhumau, Dakinyam Bhimasankaram, Sethubandhe thu Ramesam, Nagesam thu Darukavane, Varanasyam thu Viswesam, Trayambakam Gouthami thate, Himalaye thu Kedaram, Ghushmesam cha Shivalaye, Ethani Jyothirlingani sayam pratha paden nara, Saptha janma krutham papam smaranena vinasyathi.

"Parlam Vaidyanatham cha" instead of "Vaidyanatham Chitabhumau" is an alternative reading for it.

Adi Shankaracharya further evaluates the above main verse as below:[6][7]

Poorvottare prajwalika nidhaane
sada vasantam girija sametam
suraasuraaradhita paada padmam
shri vaidyanaatham tamaham namaami

This states that:

I salute that Vaidyanatha, Whose lotus feet are worshipped By all asuras and devas and who lives in a place of eternal shine, in the north east of (Vaidyanatham) of Chitabhoomi, along with his consort Parvathi.
